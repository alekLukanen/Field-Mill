# Electric Field Mill
This repository contains a bunch of images I took over the
course of building my electric field mill. I built it during
my senior year of highschool and was more concerned with 
learning than I was with documenting anything so all I have
are these pictures and some of the programs. I still have the
device but I need to fix the slew rate of the integrating
op-amp to have accurate electric field readings for quickly
changing electric fields, such as those produced by weather. 
It can measure slowly changing electric fields very accuratly
, but quickly changing electric fields can overload the op-amp. 

The images in this repository should give a fairly good idea
of what I did. If there is enought interest I will upload the
STL files and include a few notes on how I designed the 
field mill.
