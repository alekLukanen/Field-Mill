# Electric Field Mill
This repository contains a bunch of images I took over the
course of building my electric field mill. I built it during
my senior year of highschool and was more concerned with 
learning than I was with documenting anything so all I have
is these pictures and some of the programs. I still have the
device but I need to fix the sloow rate of the integrating
op-amp to have accurate electric field readings. It can measure
slowly changing electric fields very accuratly, but quickly
changing electric fields can be difficult to measure. 

The images in this repository should give a fairly good idea
of what I did.
